# MiQuizZero

MiQuizZero è un'applicazione per testare le proprie capacità, con dei quiz personalizzati.
Il nome è un'assonanza con la frase "io faccio un quiz per mettermi alla prova".

## How to use

The application can be used on a computer or mobile device, and you can also "install" it on the device.
You need to download the [quiz-data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobboteck/miquizzero/refs/heads/master/quiz-data.json) file locally and load it from the interface.
You can use the sample file as a basis for creating your own quiz file. I'll be working on a specific Editor soon.
